# IllusorySigMaker.idc 0.0.2
-**SigMaker .idc script For IDA. (Multiplatform)** <br>
**-Latest Version:** 0.0.2 <br>

**Information:**
Added an example ida.idc file that has our IllusorySigMaker <br>script built into it with a shortcut/hotkeys.<br>
To gain this functionality you would edit your existing <br>"ida.idc" scipt in "/ida/idc/"<br>
or if the file doesn't already exist you would have to <br>create it or copy paste my file into your folder.<br>

**-IllusorySigMaker.idc:** <br>
Use like a normal idc script. (File->ScriptCommand->Import).

**-ida.idc:** <br>
Use only if you want to have the script auto start with all your IDA projects with *CLTR-ALT-S* hotkey functionality.

Will improve this later on to include all good/safe op-codes for each instruction.
