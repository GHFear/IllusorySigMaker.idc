# IllusorySigMaker.idc 0.0.2
SigMaker .idc script For IDA. (Multiplatform)<br>
Latest Version: 0.0.2

Added an example ida.idc file that has our IllusorySigMaker script built into it with a shortcut/hotkeys.<br>
To gain this functionality you would edit your existing "ida.idc" scipt in "/ida/idc/"<br>
or if the file doesn't already exist you would have to create it or copy paste my file into your folder.

**IllusorySigMaker.idc:** Use like a normal idc script. (File->ScriptCommand->Import).

**ida.idc:** Use only if you want to have the script auto start with all your IDA projects with *CLTR-ALT-S* hotkey functionality.

Will improve this later on to include all good/safe op-codes for each instruction.
