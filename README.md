# IllusorySigMaker.idc
SigMaker .idc script For IDA. (Multiplatform)<br>

Added an example ida.idc file that has our IllusorySigMaker script built into it with a shortcut/hotkeys.<br>
To gain this functionality you would editor your existing "ida.idc" scipt in "/ida/idc/"<br>
or if the file doesn't already exist you would have to create it or copy paste my file into your folder.
